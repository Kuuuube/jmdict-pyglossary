# JMdict PyGlossary

This repository contains automatically generated dictionaries for use with PyGlossary supported formats. They are built using information from the [JMdict](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project) project, which is a freely available Japanese dictionary maintained by the [Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group](http://www.edrdg.org/). There are also releases for [JMnedict](https://www.edrdg.org/enamdict/enamdict_doc.html), which is a Japanese proper names dictionary.

This repository is automatically updated daily and the dictionary files are built from JMdict using [PyGlossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary).

## FAQ

### How Often Should I Update?

- The **JMdict** project [is quite active](https://www.edrdg.org/jmwsgi/updates.py?svc=jmdict&i=1) so we recommend you update your JMdict files every few months as lots of entries are added and improved upon every single day by contributers. You can even [contribute to the project here](https://www.edrdg.org/jmwsgi/edhelpq.py?svc=jmdict&sid=).

- The **JMnedict** project is [also somewhat active](https://www.edrdg.org/jmwsgi/updates.py?svc=jmdict&i=1) although arguably less relevant.
